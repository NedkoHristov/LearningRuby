# ruby thoughts from https://rubymonk.com

* In Ruby, just like in real life, our world is filled with objects. Everything is an object - integers, characters, text, arrays - everything. 

* One object interacts with another by using what are called methods. More specifically, one object "calls or invokes the methods" of another object.

* When talking to an object via its methods, it is possible to give it additional information so it can give you an appropriate response.

* This additional information is called the "arguments to a method." The name "argument" makes sense if you stop to think about the fact that methods are the paths of communication between objects.
